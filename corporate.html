          <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Our color scheme:

                  #FABC3C
                  <em>The main color, yellow which resembles gold, is used all across our website. Gold stands for  luxury, success, achievement. It is also a bold, strong color that fits our values of strength, unapologetic, self-love and independence. Gold is the perfect balance between feminine, bold and luxury. Finally, Gold is often associated with luxurious, premium jewelry which is what we are also offering.</em>
                </li>
				   <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #272727;"></span>
                  #272727
                  <em>This customized version of black is used in headings, our logo and decorations of pictures, columns and rows. It stands for power and elegance, which both fit our brand values and product seamlessly.  </em>
                </li>
				   <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #f5f5f5;"></span>
                  #f5f5f5
                  <em>This customized version of white is used in decorations and our logo. It is a bit softer white, which allows it to work better with the other colors on our website. Finally, it helps to break up the darker colours of black, gold and brown which allows our website to not look too dark. </em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #4a3821;"></span>
                  #4a3821
                  <em>Brown symbolizes warmth and security. it is implemented in our logos and These elements relate closely to our brand, since our product is meant to help women express and appreciate who they are and what they stand for. Furthermore, the brown matches with the gold and adds to the luxurious, premium feel of the brand.</em>
                </li>

                  <em>The secondary yellow color is used for the color of the body's background. It is a softer pastel which resembles gold. it is subtle and works well with the brown and main gold color. Again, it fits with the luxurious and premium feel of our brand. </em>

			  <li><img src="images/fontsvi.png" class="fonts"></li>
			  <p>The FemmeForward Heading fonts are strong, bold and luxurious looking fonts that represent what we stand for. The body font of Ubuntu is a bit softer with rounded edges, to emphasize the feminine target group of our brand.</p>
            <li>User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</li>
			  <p> a.
The dark brown navigation bar is present on all pages of the website. It gives a first impression to the users. This serves to make all pages of the website easily accessible for the users. The white image on the navigation bar serves to make our brand logo stand out to the users. We added a yellow shadow which resembles a glow to resemble the hint of gold on our jewelry.<br>
The yellow text and lines are used in the navigation bar are used to show separation between the different pages. They stand out in contrast to the dark brown. When you hover over the text in the navigation bar, the text turns black to accentuate what you are viewing. 
The button on the navigation bar serves to make known to our users that they can donate to our cause. The lighter color in comparison to the brown helps the button to stand out and instigate curiosity about what they are donating to and makes donating accessible for the users.
Buttons with the same style are used throughout the website to keep a cohesive visual of buttons. When you hover over them, there is an outline and and the text turns white. This is to make clear that it is a clickable button.<br>
When you are on a page, the text turns white and there is a yellow underline. The colors used for these elements stand out from the brown and makes clear to the user what page they are currently on. <br>
The carousel on the home page serves to make known to the users what product we are offering at first glance. The use of white feels clean and brings attention to the black and gold jewelry and the yellow text in the image.<br>
We used cards to make it clear to the user that we have two different tiers. The carousel in the cards on the Support us page is used as an element to visualize the rewards we will give to the possible investors to the best of our abilities and make attractive.<br>
We made individual borders with yellow accents and shadows and white background to make the titles stand out from regular text. We also used this for the values to make clear what we stand for as a brand. This is a similar border used for the cards on the Support us page.
 </p>
            <li>The structure of the <strong>navigation and content</strong> (e.g. how content units are distributed across pages)</li>
			  <p> b. On the home page, there is a carousel to make clear to the consumer what our products are and instigate curiosity. 
There have a picture of a woman from our target audience and an explanation of who we are as a brand and a link to the about us page for them to learn more about who we are and what we stand for. Directly under, there is a picture of our product demo and an explanation of the product that we offer. This is to give the consumer an idea of the product we are raising funds to create. There is also a link directing them to the Support us Page so they get more information about hwy they should support us and how they can do this. <br>
On the about us page, there is our vision at the top, so that the users get a direct idea of what we stand for. Directly under that there are our values in blocks to accentuate what is really important to us. After this we have photos of the team to create a sense of trustworthiness towards our audience, under which there are working links to our social media websites, so the consumers have direct access to follow us on these pages. <br>
On the Support Us page, there is an option with two cards to pick your tier. This makes clear to the investor that there are multiple options to invest in our brand. With a working donate button for the consumers to choose the amount they would like to donate. Under this, there is some information on why they should invest in our brand and a description of our products, so they feel more compelled to donate to our cause.

          <h2 id="production-3" class="mt-2 productpageheadings">Testing Report</h2>
          
          <p>In order to test our website, we have conducted 4 sessions of testing. The testing was conducted on a desktop, laptop and phone to make sure our testing results would provide us with as much information as possible. All testing sessions were done with our final website.&nbsp;</p>
          <h4>&nbsp;testing goals:</h4>
          <p>&nbsp;Our testing goals can be split up into 2 parts, the UX and the UI.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- For the testing of the UX, our goal was to find out what our users felt while interacting with our website. For example: is the design confusing? does it look nice? is it clear what our website is about at first glace?&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- For the testing of the UI, our goals were to find our whether all website elements were functioning properly, if the website works on different devices and if the design of the website was clear and easy to use.&nbsp;</p>
          <h4>&nbsp;Testing methods:</h4>
          <p>&nbsp;testing participants: We used a total of 4 testing participants for our website testing. Due to a lack of time, we were able to only conduct testing on 2 people that matched with our target audience. However, the other 2 testing participants were still given the same instructions and the testing still provided valuable and useful information for us.</p>
          <h4>&nbsp;Test setting:&nbsp;</h4>
          <p>&nbsp;- participant 1: Testing was done remotely. The testing was done on an Iphone X in Google Chrome. The testing participant was given instructions and was asked questions via Discord (Online video calling service). Since this testing session was done on a phone and the website was coded for PC, this testing was video recorded to see the reactions of the testing participant and display of the website on their phone screen.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;- Testing participant 2: Testing was done remotely. The testing was done on a laptop                on Google Chrome. The audio of the testing has been recorded. She was given instructions to navigate through our website and was asked questions about our website.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>-&nbsp; testing participant 3: Testing was done at campus, in person. It was done on a laptop using Google Chrome.  They were given instructions to navigate through our website and was asked questions about our website.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>-&nbsp; testing participant 4: Testing was done at campus, in person. It was done on a laptop using FireFox. They were given instructions to navigate through our website and was asked questions about our website.&nbsp;</p>
          <h4>&nbsp;Testing protocol&nbsp;</h4>
          <p>&nbsp;During every testing session, testing participants were asked what kind of emotions, reactions or feelings they were experiencing while viewing our website. (e.g. By viewing our landing page only, could you tell me what our website is about and whatour brand stands for? What do you think about the color palette? what do you think about the decorations? is it inviting to read? Is it confusing? etc.)&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;Additionally, they were given multiple simple tasks to navigate through our website and find a specific element on the website. (e.g. Find our instagram page, Find the pictures about the team, If you were to donate, how would you be able to do that? become a premium member, please? Please find our vision, please find the “independence” value? can you tell the difference between the advantages of being an investor and premium investor?  etc.)</p>
          <h4>Testing results</h4>
          <p>After each finding, there are numbers. For example, when theres a 1 and a 2 after a finding, that means that that finding was derived from the testing session with participant 1 and 2.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;From all the testing sessions, we have concluded the following positive UI/UX elements, ranked from most important to least important:&nbsp;</p>
          <p>-&nbsp; Navigating through our website was easy and clear, thanks to the limited amount of options in our navbar and the compact paragraphs of text. (UI / UX) 1, 2, 3,  4</p>
          <p>-&nbsp; They were able to recognize that our product was jewelry by just looking at our landing page (thanks to the carousel and the text). (UX) 1, 2 ,3</p>
          <p>-&nbsp; Good amount of information available on the website and it is inviting to read (not too long pieces of text) 1, 2&nbsp;</p>
          <p>-&nbsp; Donation page was easy to find thanks to the big call to action button (UI).  2, 3 ,4&nbsp;</p>
          <p>-&nbsp; They were able to tell our brand was about strong, women by looking at our landing page only. (UX) 1</p>
          <p>-&nbsp; difference between Investor and Premium Investor is clear (UX) 1, 3, 4&nbsp;</p>
          <p>-&nbsp; Liked the color palette and the consistency of our style guide. (UX) 1 ,2</p>
          <p>-&nbsp; Found it nice that the social media logo buttons directed them to our social media pages (UX, UI) 1, 3</p>
          <p>-&nbsp; Really liked the carousel (UX) 1, 3</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>From all the testing sessions, we have concluded the following negative UI/UX elements, ranked from most important to least important:&nbsp;</p>
          <p>-&nbsp; Website looks different and doesn’t function 100% properly on a phone (“Donate” button in the navbar is barely visible, some details get lost on the phone’s display such as the lines under text, pictures / text boxes are not positioned correctly) 1&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- No clear “Products” page is in the Navbar (UI) which caused  confusion (UX) 3, 4&nbsp;</p>
          <p>-&nbsp; Website doesn’t look very professional (UX) 4&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;- The colors themselves didn’t tell her that our brand was a women’s brand. (UI &amp; UX )2&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;- Couldn’t always immediately recognize that the vision was on top of the about us page, since it doesn’t say “our vision” anywhere. (UX) 1&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;- A price range would be better for the funding tiers, a fixed price is confusing (UX) 2&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>&nbsp;Improvements that would be made in the future, with more time and knowledge to our availability:</h4>
          <p>&nbsp;- Fix the display of the website on phones (properly position buttons so that they’re clearly visible, make sure all pictures and text are properly positioned on the website and make it look pretty, just like on desktop)</p>
          <p>-&nbsp; Make it more clear that the first paragraph of text on our about us page is the brand vision by adding a heading to it.</p>
          <p>-&nbsp; Add social media hyperlinks to buttons and adding them to the navbar to make it easier for the customers to find our social media pages.</p>
          <p>-&nbsp; Make a more clear navigation in the navbar to read more about our products by adding a separate button / link for it.</p>
          <p>-&nbsp; Make it even more clear on the landing page that this is a FUNDING website rather than a functioning webshop by reworking the design of the landing page, perhaps add a banner on top of the page that makes it clear. </p>

          <h4 id="management-1" class="mt-2">Lean Canvas</h4>

          <p>Fill in at least 2 bullet points per building block and according to the rubrics.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li>There are a few brands that are also focused on celebrating woman and their achievements. For example, the brand Glamour. Glamour focusses on different aspects of those achievements, whether they are social, economic, cultural, or political. This brand does not only focus on the achievements, but also raises awareness around gender bias, promoting equality and stands for the woman’s independence.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>&nbsp;Another brand that recognizes the problems we found is the brand, Monica Vinader. This brand celebrates women by making them feel individual and confident every day. She designs jewellery that empowers, uplifts and endures using only recycled gold vermeil, sterling silver and sustainably sourced natural gemstones, diamonds and pearls.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>&nbsp;Thirdlove is another brand that offers a solution for woman having high standards. ThirdLove is a lingerie brand that focuses on fit, comfort, and inclusivity. The brand offers a wide range of sizes and styles to help women feel confident and comfortable in their lingerie, regardless of their relationship status.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>&nbsp;The brand Shine is is a self-care app that helps users prioritize their mental health and well-being. The app offers guided meditations, motivational messages, and personalized self-care tips to help users feel more centred and focused on themselves. </li>

          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To come to a final product, the brand solution went through a journey. We began formulating ideas for a solution as soon as we became aware of the woman's issues. At the beginning, we had the idea to create a company that hosts events for middle-aged single women so they can connect, share experiences, and feel a sense of community.&nbsp;
            Besides this idea, we also came up with a jewellery brand that stands for the independence for woman. We asked the woman in our solution interviews what they would think of these ideas and if they are willing to pay for these services/products. We figured out in two interviews (Lise: Simone Kokx, Sandra van Meel) that our participants would prefer a jewellery brand more, because of the lack of time to go to events. This is how we came to our final determination that jewellery would be our end product. Women can wear this jewellery, which features a shortened version of our logo, to remind themselves that they are strong and independent. We also want them to feel connected and like they belong to a community when they see the emblem on other women wearing the same jewellery brand. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li>List your target customers and/or users.</li>
            <li>Describe briefly the characteristics of your ideal customer (early adopter, brand persona).</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We develop a brand message that empowers and inspires independent women. This includes messaging that encourages women to embrace their individuality, celebrates their achievements, or supports their causes. We offer high-quality jewellery at an accessible price point, making luxury accessible to a wider range of independent women so that they can express who they are while looking and feeling best. 

Our jewellery is made of unique designs, which is our own logo. These designs are not available elsewhere in the market and could attract independent woman who want to express their individuality through their accessories. </li>
            <li></li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our fair advantages are that we have a marketing specialist on the team, which allows us to reduce the cost of our marketing initiatives.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>&nbsp;Our team also includes an experienced programmer, which has allowed us to develop the website more quickly and at a lower cost than hiring a company to do it for us.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;Besides our experts, we benefit from networking. We have a connection to a member of our target market who became an important face in representing our brand. (Interview about Kyanni's Personal Story)&nbsp;</li>
            <li>&nbsp;Finally, our brand has a strong and active online presence, it can leverage social media and influencer marketing to reach a wider audience and build a community around its brand. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <ul>
            <li>List your main path to customers.</li>
            <li>We reach our customers through social media. We choose a target group that uses two platforms the most: Instagram and Facebook. We discovered this by doing the interviews, and the results of research (Web Solutions, Inc., 2022). With the use of Instagram and Facebook, we want people to lead to our website where they can find everything about our brand, products, and a donate opportunity. On Instagram, we made use of all functions to reach and interact with our target audience. This includes reels, posts, stories and interactive stories. On Facebook, we posted the same content. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The conversion rate metric measures the percentage of website visitors or social media followers who take a desired action, such as making a purchase or doing a donation.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Our social media engagement measures the level of engagement on the brand's social media channels, such as likes, followers, comments, and shares. A high level of engagement can indicate a strong brand following and customer loyalty.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>The Customer life-time-value measures the total value a customer brings to the brand over the course of their relationship. It considers factors like repeat purchases, referrals, and customer loyalty.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>The average order value measures the average amount of money spent by customers per order. A higher AOV can indicate that customers are buying multiple items or higher-priced items.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>The inventory turnover measures how quickly the brand is selling its inventory. A high inventory turnover indicates that the brand is effectively managing its inventory and is selling products quickly. </li>
<li>Finally, the amount of sales can be measured easily via the website.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li>List your sources of revenue: describe the revenue model and the (different) revenue stream(s).</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
          <ul>
            <li>List your main costs: define the fixed and variable costs.</li>
            <li>Calculate the cost per unit.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <ul>
            <li>State what your product and/or service is and how this contributes to your unique value proposition.</li>
            <li>Clarify the fit between the product/service developed and the brand identity/brand image.</li>
          </ul>
